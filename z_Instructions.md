LeaseLabs/DZAP Front-End Web Developer Test
=============================

**Please clone/download the test from the following location**
+ https://github.com/dzap/test-web-developer

Please markup the provided website PSD using HTML, CSS and Javascript. A layered Photoshop file has been provided. Please contact us if any instruction is unclear. Thank you!

**Rules and Requirements**
+ You may use any html/css/js library or framework, except for dealing with the image object which is detailed below. Please keep in mind we are more interested in simplicity and your command of the front-end development languages than libraries and frameworks.
+ Please use your judgement to make this page responsive. It doesnâ€™t need to be anything fancy, just appropriately styled mobile and desktop versions. Simpler versions of elements on mobile is ok. 
+ You may use a framework if you like, but extra consideration will be given if you can example your command of simple media queries. Bonus points for exampling a "mobile first" approach.
+ Pixel perfection is not expected. We are more interested in conveying the feel of the design.
+ For the 3 column image section please reference the images object in app.js. Each of the images contain an image path, a heading, and description text. Use this object to build a 3-column image section at the bottom of the content area, showing images and their associated hover states.


**What We're Interested In**
+ Command of Languages
+ Modern Best Practices
+ Intentional and Strategic Organization of Code
+ Efficiency and Cleanliness in Code
+ Browser Compatibility
+ Attention to Detail
+ Usability

**Bonus Points**
+ The use of SASS compiled down to CSS
