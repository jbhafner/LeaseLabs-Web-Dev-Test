=============================

**Notes**
- I picked the colors by uploading the png copy of the mockup to imagecolorpicker.com to get the HTML/Hex color code.  To zoom in on some finer details, like the nav bar text, I had to use MS Paint to get the RGB value, and then convert to hex using convertingcolors.com.
